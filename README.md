The birth rates across most countries in Europe and Asia have drastically changed over the last few decades, indicating the rate at which their populations are expanding. 
These changes are influenced by several factors, including socio-cultural and healthrelated indicators that affect reproductive behaviour across different regions. There is 
a worry that declining birth rates could lead to a shortage of working-age individuals in the future who can support healthcare and social welfare systems, which will be under 
greater strain due to rising demands. Gietel-Basten, S., Rotkirch, A., & Sobotka, T. (2022). 

Understanding these factors and their varying impacts on birth rates is crucial for creating policies and interventions to support health and ensure sustainable population growth. Such insight is essential for addressing the challenges and 
opportunities related to population dynamics. By identifying the drivers behind birth rate variations, policymakers can develop targeted interventions to promote health and 
achieve sustainable population growth. The main objectives of this research are as follows.

I. Evaluate the significance of relationships between birth rates and associated factors across Asia and Europe
II. Analyse how birth rate trends change over time across the two regions.
III. Check whether Asia and Europe's average population growth and fertility rate are the same.
IV. Build models that can predict future birth rates in the two regions combined.
